        <p class="text">We still remember that On May 10, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed classified
            information to Russian government representatives, creating political and security concerns in the United
            States and its allies, especially Israel. It seems that the Donald Trump's disclosures of classified
            information is a hot topic in tweets.

        <p class="text">Skynews, a famous UK Car Radio Media.The result tell us that which tell us that skynews might be
            the first media to recover the Donald Trump's disclosures of classified information. With the assumption, I
            search in the google with the key word 'Sky New, Trump, Russia'. This is the first searching result
            'Christopher Steele: Confessions of a former British spy on Johnson, Putin, Trump, and James Bond'. It
            proves my judgement.</p>

        <p class="text">There is only one center point of the whole network "skynews". Other points are surrounding the
            center and their words are always overlapping. Most frequency keyword are "British", "Russia", "Trump",
            indicating that skynews is a media in England and report the Donald Trump's disclosures of classified
            information.</p>

        <p class="text">Three different decision trees chose the total number of county votes as the most important
            classification feature. This indicates that there is a very strong association between the number of votes
            in the state and the supporters in the 2016 election.</p>

        <p class="text">I checked the relevant information and found that
            Trump's supporting states are mostly from the more sparsely populated and economically underdeveloped
            states. While Hillary's support states are mostly from economically developed, highly populated states such
            as California.Thatâ€™s the most valuable information found in Decision Tree.</p>

        <p class="text">I chose the text of Trump's tweets and divided the statements made before and after Trump was
            elected president into two categories, and tried to use a Bayesian model to classify the
            tweets made before and after Trump was elected president.I used the pca dimensionality reduction technique
            to reduce the X independent variable to 2
            dimensions and plotted categorical scatter plots for visualising the decision boundaries of the Bayesian
            model. The results are very interesting, with the data points appearing as radial lines. And the model
            argues that the bottommost presenting radial data points appear to be in two categories. It can therefore be
            argued that Trump's rhetoric began to take on a different character before 2016.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="text">And I got some important information from wiki.</p>
        <br/>
        <div class="text">
            <i>The 2016 U.S. presidential election kicked off in mid-2015, and since Trump announced his
                candidacy as a Republican on June 16, 2015, there have been some changes in the Republican Party's power
                map. The poll found that the majority of Trump supporters were white men and lower-class workers, the
                main
                opponents of various economic free trade agreements and immigration-related bills, especially against
                allowing illegal immigrants to have residency.</i>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <div class="text">
            <i>Trump defeated 16 opponents in the party primary, the largest number of candidates in U.S.
                history, and on March 3, 2016, he was essentially confirmed as the Republican presidential nominee.</i>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <h3 class="title">SVM Part</h3>
        <br/>
        <p class="text">The svm with default parameters does not effectively utilize qualitative variables such as
            county affiliation and does not effectively distinguish between the statements made by Hillary and Trump
            during the presidential election. My interpretation is that statistical information such as number and vote
            share do not differ significantly between counties supporting different candidates, and thus do not
            distinguish well between Trump-supporting and Hillary-supporting counties. If we need to improve the
            classification effect, we need to add information such as the economic development of the county and replace
            the Gaussian kernel to solve the dimensional explosion problem brought by one-hot variables.</p>
