Last night, our Country‚Äôs brave warriors rescued an American hostage in Nigeria. Our Nation salutes the courageous soldiers behind the daring nighttime rescue operation and celebrates the safe return of yet another American citizen!
We will soon be learning about the word ‚Äúcourage‚Äù, and saving our Country. I received hundreds of thousands of legal votes more, in all of the Swing States, than did my opponent.   ALL Data taken after the vote says that it was impossible for me to lose, unless FIXED!

There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone.....

For decades, Joe Biden let other countries rip you off and cheat America blind! The only people who‚Äôve benefited from his policies are himself &amp; his family. He shows up every 4 years, and then goes back to D.C. and caters to his special interests. My only special interest is YOU.
How do states and politicians confirm an election where corruption and irregularities are documented throughout? A Swing State hustle!
Joe Biden is the candidate of rioters, looters, arsonists, gun-grabbers, flag-burners, Marxists, lobbyists, and special interests. I am the candidate of farmers, factory workers, police officers, and hard-working, law-abiding patriots of every race, religion and creed! #MAGA

We now have far more votes than needed to flip Georgia in the Presidential race. Massive VOTER FRAUD took place. Thank you to the Georgia Legislature for today‚Äôs revealing meeting!

....is therefore both illegal and invalid, and that would include the two current Senatorial Elections. In Wisconsin, Voters not asking for applications invalidates the Election. All of this without even discussing the millions of fraudulent votes that were cast or altered!

For historical purposes remember, I was able to get rid of the INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, the most unpopular and expensive part of ObamaCare. You are no longer forced to pay a fortune for the ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù of NOT getting bad healthcare. This ended ObamaCare as we knew it. Thank you!

The Swing States did not even come close to following the dictates of their State Legislatures. These States  ‚Äúelection laws‚Äù were made up by local judges &amp; politicians, not by their Legislatures, &amp; are therefore, before even getting to irregularities &amp; fraud, UNCONSTITUTIONAL!

Biden wants to Pack the Court with Radical Left crazies. He doesn‚Äôt even want to make a list to explain who they are. Can‚Äôt let this happen!
Obama is campaigning for us. Every time he speaks, people come over to our side. He didn‚Äôt even want to endorse Sleepy Joe. Did so long after primaries were over!
Finally! Suburban women are flocking over to us. They realize that I am saving the Suburbs - the American Dream! I terminated the Regulation that would bring projects and crime to Suburbia. Not on my watch! Biden will bring the Regulation back, but bigger and worse.
Wow!!! NOW DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS, THE BIGGEST OF ALL POLITICAL SCANDALS (IN HISTORY)!!! BIDEN, OBAMA AND CROOKED HILLARY LED THIS TREASONOUS PLOT!!! BIDEN SHOULDN‚ÄôT BE ALLOWED TO RUN - GOT CAUGHT!!! https://t.co/hf7zjqZYQ4

Nancy Pelosi just got duped in an interview to admitting that she has been working on impeaching me for ‚Äútwo and a half years.‚Äù In other words, she lied. This was the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats plan all along, long before the Ukraine phone call. Impeachment Hoax!

.....by Congress, by the Justice Department &amp, FBI friends of the Democrats, who hated the president when he was nothing but a candidate. At some point somebody should have said, wait a minute, this is out of control, this train is off the tracks, it‚Äôs time to get reasonable.‚Äù
