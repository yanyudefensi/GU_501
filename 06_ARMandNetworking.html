        <p class="text">I got some tweets from Twitter API with the topic of 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. Clean them
            and transfer them to the
            transaction data so that it's convenience for us to use Associate Rules Mining to analyze and use
            network
            visualization skills to discover

        <p class="title">It seems that everything is about the election and time. Most words have a strong demanding
            meaning and inspire the desire of voters to act. The hot word in tweets about the election is similar to
            Hillary and Trump personal tweets. That's an interesting finding. Maybe people tends to cite sentences from
            their leaders.</p>
        <br/>
        <h4 class="title">Introduction of Associate Rules Mining</h4>
        <p class="text">Association rules learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting
            relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in
            databases using some measures of interestingness.
            Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieli≈Ñski and Arun Swami introduced
            association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by
            point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. And let me introduce three important indicators.</p>
        <p class="title">Support: Sup(X,Y)=P(X,Y)</p>
        <p class="title">Confidence: Conf(X,Y)=P(Y|X)</p>
        <p class="title">Lift: Lift(X,Y)=Sup(X,Y)/(Sup(X)*Sup(Y))</p>
        <p class="text">With the help of three indicator, we use Apriori to calculate the interesting associate rules
            in the database.Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning. It
            identifies items in the database which appear sufficiently enough and the result can be applied to many
            domians such as market analysis.</p>
        <p class="title">ItemSets -> Generate K-Itemset, Candidates(Join Steps) ->Checking Support

            ->Frequent Items -> Set of K-1 frequent itemsets is None?(IF no, Return Generate K-Itemset)

            ->Stop</p>
        <p class="title">Because there are many overlapping rules in the text dataset. In order to collect effective
            information, we decide to filter most of the rules and keep rank 15 part of support, confidence, lift for
            further research.</p>
        <br/>
        <h4 class="title">Table Of The Top 15 Rules For Support</h4>
        <br/>
        <img src="resource/sortSupport.png" alt="Simply Easy Learning" width="900" height="400" class="displayed">
        <p class="title">That's valuable information from this ranking support table. You see,
            christopher,collusion,russia always appear together. Therefore, they take over the ranked 3 position in the
            table. We still remember that
            On May 10, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed classified information to Russian government
            representatives, creating political and security concerns in the United States and its allies, especially
            Israel. It seems that the Donald Trump's disclosures of classified information is a hot topic in tweets</p>
        <br/>
        <h4 class="title">Table Of The Top 15 Rules For Confidence</h4>
        <img src="resource/sortConfidence.png" alt="Simply Easy Learning" width="900" height="400"

        <p class="text">From the rank 15 confidence table, you can know when Skynews appear,then follow the
            Dossier,Collusion,Russia,Trump, which tell us that
            skynews might be the first media to recover the Donald Trump's disclosures of classified information. With
            the assumption, I search in the google with the key word 'Sky Mew,Trump,Russia'. This is the first searching
            result 'Christopher Steele: Confessions of a former British spy on Johnson, Putin, Trump, and James Bond'.
            It proves my judgement.</p>

        <p class="text">When lift is higher than 1, it means that X and Y have positive relationship and be possible to
            appear together. From the table, we
            know that
            sky new focus their attention on reporting Donald Trump's disclosures of classified information, which leads
            to a strong positive relationship between skynews and russia,trump,collusion,steele.</p>

        <p class="text">Since the network plot in NetworkD3 is the most clear and impressive, we use this plot to
            explain some interesting finding. There is only one center point of the whole network "skynews". Other
            points are surrounding the center and their words are always overlapping. Most frequency keyword are
            "British","Russia","Trump", indicating that skynews is a media in England and report the the Donald Trump's
            disclosures of classified information.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Some discussion about Associate Rules Mining and Network Visualization</h3>
        <br/>
        <p class="text">Using Associate Rules Mining, we find that it's skynews, a famous media from England,
            reported the Donald Trump's disclosures of classified information. It's a hot politic topic in 2017 and
            become an important part of American political struggle. With the help of tweets analysis, we realize that
            2016 president election is controversial. And many people can not accept Trump policy, leading to an
            enormous
            conflict in 2017.That's why I am interested in the 2016 president in the United States, Trump doesn't stand
            for Republican and Democratic interests, as a result, Trump always suffers from serious political
            allegations.
            It's hard to say Trump's policy is suitable for America.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="text">Also, the network visualization is a Radial network structure. The center is Skynews,
            connecting points about Trump, Russia,
            christopher, England. Since just one center in the whole network structure, we can make a conclusion that
            skynews report the Donald Trump's disclosures of classified information. The result is similar with the
            associate
            rules mining. But it doesn't mean that network visualization is useless. If there are several center,
            we can
            notice the distance between different centers and discover some valuable information from the visualization.
            For example,
            which kind of center is similar. That's one of the key value of the network plot.
